# ClusterPack

Cluster-as-a-Library project that aims to bring a [SWIM-based](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asdas/research/dsn02-swim.pdf) cluster membership protocol support in form of library that can be embedded into custom user application. It doesn't aim to introduce any kind of higher-level patterns or abstractions (like actors), only to simplify cluster membership management.
